# LayoutFixer ⌨️✨

**Fix text typed in the wrong keyboard language — instantly.**

LayoutFixer is a lightweight Windows tray app that converts already-typed text from one keyboard layout to another  
(e.g. Hebrew ↔ English, Arabic ↔ English, Russian ↔ English) **without dictionaries or hardcoded mappings**.

It works by mapping **physical QWERTY key positions**, just like you actually typed them.

Select the text → press a hotkey → done ✅
